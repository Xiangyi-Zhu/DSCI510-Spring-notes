1. Why database?
When you have lots of data, too much to store in main memory, you need to organize your data and be able to 
find what you need quickly.

2. Database Management System (DBMS):
Collection of programs that manage the database structure, store things on disk, evaluate queries efficiently...

3. DBMS interacts between end users and database
you have data stored at hard drive (storage),  DBMS interacts with the drives and allows end users to query data

4. There are different levels of storage in your computer:
main memory (RAM:random access memory) 
hard drive / solid state drive...
Those have different latencies, different speed of access

5. There are a number of databases, the one  we look at in this lecture is relational databases (tables)
You can retrieve data and relate multiple tables and query them at the same time.

6. Terminology:
Database: contains many tables
Relation (or table): contains tuples and attributes
Tuple (row): a set of fields that represent an object (entity), like a person or track
Attribute (column or field): some aspects of entities

7. SQL:
create data (insert)
retrieve data
updata data
delete data

8. Some SQL languages:
SQLite Browser is used: (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
can be found at https://www.py4e.com/lectures3/Pythonlearn-15-Database-Handout.txt
CREATE TABLE "Users" ("name" TEXT, "email" TEXT)
INSERT INTO Users (name, email) VALUES ('Chuck', 'csev@umich.edu')
DELETE FROM Users WHERE email='ted@umich.edu'
UPDATE Users SET name="Charles" WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
SELECT * FROM Users
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY email
SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY name DESC

9. Create Database in Python (see jupyter notebook used in class):
import import sqlite3 
conn = sqlite3.connect('emaildb.sqlite')  # emaildb.sqlite is a filename
cur = conn.cursor() #create cursor object
#cursor a concept in databases that allows you to iterate over results 
#and send queries and interact with database.

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Counts') #execute is a method of cursor object


10. Database Normalization
Use integers for keys and for references.
Add a special “key” column to each table which we will make references to. By convention, many programmers
call this column “id”

11. Three kind of keys
