1. Internet in a nutshell
1.1 Internet is a network of networks
1.2 Each computer has an address, called IP (Internet Protocol) address (IPv4 IPv6)
1.3 Domain Name System (DNS) (was invented at ISI) (IP address are numbers which may be obsure to work with):
you normally look at when you go to the web
Map IP address to nice hierarchical names.
1.4 The whole idea of Internet in a word:
Transmit some data from computerA to computerB (Host A / B)

2. Internet: Layered Architecture
From the bottom:
2.1 Link Layer (WiFI)
2.2 Network Layer (IP)
2.3 Transport Layer (TCP: transport control protocol)
assume IP might lose data, TCP will make sure to store the data
like a nice pipe, send data across computers and get data from it
2.4 Application Layer (HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol)

3. TCP connections / Sockets
endpoint of communication pipe, follows some protocals 

4. TCP Port Numbers
a number allows you to differentiate the types of data (web pages from broswer, email, 
vedios from zoom...) you wanna transmit 
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
